# LP-DB

Login Pages Database is intended to form a library of login pages related to malicious activities (C2, phishing, TDS...).

This library is linked to [URLscan.io](https://urlscan.io/), allowing to have unified size screenshots and to have access to the pages' DOM. In addition, each login page has tags to better define their use case. Whenever possible, a [Malpedia](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/) link is also present.

It's possible that some login pages don't correspond to their description or tags, these data are provided on best effort. In this case, or in order to complete the database, don't hesitate to open an issue/merger request. You can also ping me on [Tweeter](https://twitter.com/DrStache_).
